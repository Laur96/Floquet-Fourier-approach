# Floquet-Fourier-approach

Python scripts to calculate and plot the quasienergy spectra from the time-independent Floquet hamiltonian of two different physical systems which hamiltonian is expresed as the sum of a free evolution and a time-dependent periodic perturbation. 

For more details about Floquet theory, see the document https://github.com/cnborja/Floquet-Fourier-approach/blob/master/Floquet_Theory.pdf

The included systems are:
- A magnetic dipole in presence of a magnetic field and a polarized electric field
- Su-Schrieffer-Hegger model (one-dimensional topological insulator) with hoppings modulated in time

To run the script you need Python3 and the packages numpy, sympy and matplotlib.
