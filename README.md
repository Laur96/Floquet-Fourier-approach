# Floquet-Fourier-approach

In this repository you can find python codes to calculate and plot the quasienergy spectra of diferent physical systems which hamiltonian description is the sum of a free evolution and a time-dependent periodic perturbation. We use the Floquet-Fourier approach to obtain the time-independent FLoquet hamiltonian. 

For more details about Floquet theory, see the document FloquetTheory.pdf

The systems under consideration are:
- Magnetic dipole in presence of a magnetic field
- Su-Schrieffer-Hegger (SSH) model
